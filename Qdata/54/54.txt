High-resolution microscopy of deep tissue with large field-of-view (FOV) is critical for elucidating organization of cellular structures in plant biology. Microscopy with an implanted probe offers an effective solution. However, there exists a fundamental trade-off between the FOV and probe diameter arising from aberrations inherent in conventional imaging optics (typically, FOV < 30% of diameter). Here, we demonstrate the use of microfabricated non-imaging probes (optrodes) that when combined with a trained machine-learning algorithm is able to achieve FOV of 1x to 5x the probe diameter. Further increase in FOV is achieved by using multiple optrodes in parallel. With a 1 Ã— 2 optrode array, we demonstrate imaging of fluorescent beads (including 30 FPS video), stained plant stem sections and stained living stems. Our demonstration lays the foundation for fast, high-resolution microscopy with large FOV in deep tissue via microfabricated non-imaging probes and advanced machine learning.
