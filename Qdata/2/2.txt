Smartwatches have the potential to support health care in everyday life by supporting self-monitoring of health conditions and personal activities. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts the prevalence of cardiovascular disease using health-related data that can be easily measured by smartwatch users. To this end, the data corresponding to the health-related data variables provided by the smartwatch are selected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To classify the prevalence of cardiovascular disease with these selected variables, we apply logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine among machine learning classification techniques, and compare the appropriateness of the algorithm through classification performance indicators. The prediction model using support vector machine showed the highest accuracy. Next, we analyze which structures or parameters of the support vector machine contribute to increasing accuracy and derive the importance of input variables. Since it is very important to diagnose cardiovascular disease early correctly, we expect that this model will be very useful if there is a tool to predict whether cardiovascular disease develops or not.
