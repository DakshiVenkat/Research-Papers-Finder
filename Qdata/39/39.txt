With the increased development of information technology, almost all the sectors have been developed. Age, educational qualifications, gender, and other factors have no bearing on acquiring knowledge in information technology.Most humans use mobile phones and other gadgets to make their lives easier. Machine Learning techniques are used to analyse the given data and aid in the classification or prediction of the dataset depending on the problem statement. It is significant to determine human behaviour analysis in the context of sports. In this research, the Deep Learning-Deep Belief Network (DL-DBN) algorithm is implemented with probability to analyse human behaviour in sports and implement a distributed probability model for classifying the behavior. The classification results have shown that the accuracy for strength training is both the maximum and the smallest, reaching 99% and 71%, respectively.
