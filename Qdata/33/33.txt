Microplastics are contaminants of emerging concern - not only environmental, but also to human health. Characterizing them is of fundamental importance to evaluate their potential impacts and target specific actions aiming to reduce potential harming effects. This study extends the exploration of machine learning classification algorithms applied to FTIR spectra of microplastics collected at sea. A comparison of successful classification models was made in order to evaluate prediction performance for 13 classes of polymers. A rigorous methodology was applied using a pipeline scheme to avoid bias in the training and selection phases. The application of an oversampling technique also contributed by compensating unbalanceness in the dataset. The log-loss was used as the minimization function target and to assess performance. In our analysis, Support Vector Machine Classifier provides a good relationship between simplicity and performance, for a fast and useful automatic characterization of microplastics.
