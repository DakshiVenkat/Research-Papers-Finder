Population Health Management typically relies on subjective decisions to segment and stratify populations. This study combines unsupervised clustering for segmentation and supervised classification, personalised to clusters, for stratification. An increase in cluster homogeneity, sensitivity and positive predictive value was observed compared to an unlinked approach. This analysis demonstrates the potential for a cluster-then-predict methodology to improve and personalise decisions in healthcare systems.
