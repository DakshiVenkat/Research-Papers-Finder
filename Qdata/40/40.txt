Purpose of review: Artificial intelligence and its division machine learning are emerging technologies that are increasingly applied in medicine. Artificial intelligence facilitates automatization of analytical modelling and contributes to prediction, diagnostics and treatment of diseases. This article presents an overview of the application of artificial intelligence in dementia research.
Recent findings: Machine learning and its branch Deep Learning are widely used in research to support in diagnosis and prediction of dementia. Deep Learning models in certain tasks often result in better accuracy of detection and prediction of dementia than traditional machine learning methods, but they are more costly in terms of run times and hardware requirements. Both machine learning and Deep Learning models have their own strengths and limitations. Currently, there are few datasets with limited data available to train machine learning models. There are very few commercial applications of machine learning in medical practice to date, mostly represented by mobile applications, which include questionnaires and psychometric assessments with limited machine learning data processing.
Summary: Application of machine learning technologies in detection and prediction of dementia may provide an advantage to psychiatry and neurology by promoting a better understanding of the nature of the disease and more accurate evidence-based processes that are reproducible and standardized.
