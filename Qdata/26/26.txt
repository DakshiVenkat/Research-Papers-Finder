Here, we propose to develop microbiome-based machine learning models to predict the response of biological wastewater treatment systems to environmental or operational disturbances or to design specific microbiomes to achieve a desired system function. These machine learning models can be used to enhance the stability of microbiome-based biological systems and warn against the failure of these systems.
