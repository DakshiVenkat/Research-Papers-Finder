This paper presents a heart murmur detection and multi-class classification approach via machine learning. We extracted heart sound and murmur features that are of diagnostic importance and developed additional 16 features that are not perceivable by human ears but are valuable to improve murmur classification accuracy. We examined and compared the classification performance of supervised machine learning with k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. We put together a test repertoire having more than 450 heart sound and murmur episodes to evaluate the performance of murmur classification using cross-validation of 80-20 and 90-10 splits. As clearly demonstrated in our evaluation, the specific set of features chosen in our study resulted in accurate classification consistently exceeding 90% for both classifiers.
