A pivotal topic in agriculture and food monitoring is the assessment of the quality and ripeness of agricultural products by using non-destructive testing techniques. Acoustic testing offers a rapid in situ analysis of the state of the agricultural good, obtaining global information of its interior. While deep learning (DL) methods have outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks in various applications, the reason for lacking adaptation of DL algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be traced back to its high data inefficiency and the absence of annotated data. Active learning is a framework that has been heavily used in machine learning when the labelled instances are scarce or cumbersome to obtain. This is specifically of interest when the DL algorithm is highly uncertain about the label of an instance. By allowing the human-in-the-loop for guidance, a continuous improvement of the DL algorithm based on a sample efficient manner can be obtained. This paper seeks to study the applicability of active learning when grading 'Galia' muskmelons based on its shelf life. We propose k-Determinantal Point Processes (k-DPP), which is a purely diversity-based method that allows to take influence on the exploration within the feature space based on the chosen subset k. While getting coequal results to uncertainty-based approaches when k is large, we simultaneously obtain a better exploration of the data distribution. While the implementation based on eigendecomposition takes up a runtime of O(n3), this can further be reduced to O(nÂ·poly(k)) based on rejection sampling. We suggest the use of diversity-based acquisition when only a few labelled samples are available, allowing for better exploration while counteracting the disadvantage of missing the training objective in uncertainty-based methods following a greedy fashion.
