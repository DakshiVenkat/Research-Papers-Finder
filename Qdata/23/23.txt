Objective: Mammogram-based automatic breast cancer detection has a primary role in accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning to save valuable lives. Mammography is one basic yet efficient test for screening breast cancer. Very few comprehensive surveys have been presented to briefly analyze methods for detecting breast cancer with mammograms. In this article, our objective is to give an overview of recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based breast cancer detection systems.
Methods: We give a structured framework to categorize mammogram-based breast cancer detection techniques. Several publicly available mammogram databases and different performance measures are also mentioned.
Results: After deliberate investigation, we find most of the works classify breast tumors either as normal-abnormal or malignant-benign rather than classifying them into three classes. Furthermore, DL-based features are more significant than hand-crafted features. However, transfer learning is preferred over others as it yields better performance in small datasets, unlike classical DL techniques.
Significance and conclusion: In this article, we have made an attempt to give recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based breast cancer detection systems. Furthermore, a number of challenging issues and possible research directions are mentioned, which will help researchers in further scopes of research in this field.
