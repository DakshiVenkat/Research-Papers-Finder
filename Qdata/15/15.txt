In the present research we tackled the classification of seven genetic cardiac diseases and control subjects by using an extensive set of machine learning algorithms with their variations from simple K-nearest neighbor searching method to support vector machines. The research was based on calcium transient signals measured from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. All in all, 55 different machine learning alternatives were used to model eight classes by applying the principle of 10-fold crossvalidation with the peak data of 1626 signals. The best classification accuracy of approximately 69% was given by random forests, which can be seen high enough here to show machine learning to be potential for the differentiation of the eight disease classes.
