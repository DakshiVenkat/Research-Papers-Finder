Clinical neurophysiology constructs a wealth of dynamic information pertaining to the integrity and function of both central and peripheral nervous systems. As with many technological fields, there has been an explosion of data in neurophysiology over recent years, and this requires considerable analysis by experts. Computational algorithms and especially advances in machine learning (ML) have the ability to assist with this task and potentially reveal hidden insights. In this update article, we will provide a brief overview where such technology is being applied in clinical neurophysiology and possible future directions.
