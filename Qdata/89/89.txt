Employees' mental health addresses concerns in the technology industry phenomenon. Machine Learning (ML) approaches show promise in predicting mental health problems and identifying related factors. This study used three machine learning models on OSMI 2019 dataset: MLP, SVM, and Decision Tree. Five features are extracted by permutation ML's method on the dataset. The results indicate that the models have been reasonably accurate. Moreover, they could effectively support predicting employee mental health comprehension in the technology industry.
